## Project Workflows

*   [Whiteboard 3.0 Workflow](PLACEHOLDER_PATH_TO_WHITEBOARD_3.0_FOLDER_OR_DOCS)

Please replace `PLACEHOLDER_PATH_TO_WHITEBOARD_3.0_FOLDER_OR_DOCS` with the actual location of your whiteboard 3.0 folder or its documentation. This could be a relative path within the project, or a URL if it's hosted elsewhere (like a wiki or a cloud drive).
